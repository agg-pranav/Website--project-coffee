        <p>"Roasting" is one of the important stages in making coffee beans into coffee. 
        When a coffee bean is roasted, it grows nearly two times bigger and changes from green 
        to yellow to brown.</p>

        <p>The length of time that the coffee beans are roasted makes the coffee taste different. 
        Some types of coffee, such as Mocha and Java, are roasted for a short time. It is easy to 
        tell from the flavour where the coffee is from. When coffee is roasted for a long time, it 
        is harder to tell the different types apart. Green coffee beans can be bought and roasted at 
        home in the oven.</p> 
                
        <p>Roasting coffee transforms the chemical and physical properties of green coffee beans into 
        roasted coffee products. The roasting process is what produces the characteristic flavor of coffee 
        by causing the green coffee beans to change in taste. Unroasted beans contain similar if not higher 
        levels of acids, protein, sugars, and caffeine as those that have been roasted, but lack the taste of 
        roasted coffee beans due to the Maillard and other chemical reactions that occur during roasting.</p>
                
        <p>The vast majority of coffee is roasted commercially on a large scale, but small-scale commercial 
        roasting has grown significantly with the trend toward "single-origin" coffees served at specialty shops. 
        Some coffee drinkers even roast coffee at home as a hobby in order to both experiment with the flavor 
        profile of the beans and ensure the freshest possible roast.</p>
                
        <p>The first recorded implements for roasting coffee beans were thin pans made from metal or porcelain, used 
        in the 15th century in the Ottoman Empire and Greater Persia. In the 19th century, various patents were awarded 
        in the U.S. and Europe for commercial roasters, to allow for large batches of coffee. In the 1950s just as instant 
        coffee was becoming a popular coffee drink, speciality coffee-houses began opening to cater to the connoisseur, 
        offering a more traditionally brewed beverage. In the 1970s, more speciality coffee houses were founded, ones that 
        offered a variety of roasts and beans from around the world. In the 1980s and 1990s, the gourmet coffee industry 
        experienced great growth. This trend continued into the 21st Century.</p>
