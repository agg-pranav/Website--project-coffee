        <h1>Making Coffee</h1>

        <h2>Brewing</h2>

        <p>Brewed coffee is made by pouring hot water onto ground coffee beans, 
        then allowing to brew. There are several methods for doing this, including 
        using a filter, a percolator, and a French press. Terms used for the 
        resulting coffee often reflect the method used, such as drip brewed coffee, 
        filtered coffee, pour-over coffee, immersion brewed coffee, or simply coffee. 
        Water seeps through the ground coffee, absorbing its constituent chemical compounds, 
        and then passes through a filter. The used coffee grounds are retained in the filter, 
        while the brewed coffee is collected in a vessel such as a carafe or pot.</p> 

        <p>Drip brewing is a widely used method of coffee brewing. There are several 
        manual drip-brewing devices on the market, offering a little more control 
        over brewing parameters than automatic machines, and which incorporate stopper 
        valves and other innovations that offer greater control over steeping time and 
        the proportion of coffee to water. There also exist small, portable, 
        single-serving drip brew makers that only hold the filter and rest on top of 
        a mug or cup, making them a popular option for backcountry campers and hikers. 
        Hot water is poured in and drips directly into the cup.</p>

        <h3 id="boiling">Boiling</h3>
        <p>The coffee and the water are put into a pot on top of the stove and boiled slowly
        together. This way of making coffee has been used for hundreds of years. It is the 
        way that coffee is usually made in the Middle East, North Africa, Turkey and Greece.</p>

        <section>
        <h3 id="steeping">Steeping</h3>
        <p>Boiling water is poured onto the coffee and it is allowed to stand for a little 
        while, until the water has taken the colour and flavour. This is often done in a 
        cafeti√®re, which is a tall glass or coffee pot which has a special filter inside 
        that can be pushed down when the coffee is ready so that the person does not drink 
        the coffee grounds. Another way of steeping coffee is to have coffee grounds in a 
        small packet, the right size to make one cup of coffee. The packet is placed in the 
        cup and water poured over it. Then the packet is removed.</p>

        <h3 id="filtration">Filtration Methods</h3>
        <p>Filtered coffee is made by gravity because the boiling water falls from a machine onto 
        the coffee. The coffee grounds are held in a paper or metal "filter" that the water can 
        run through, but the little coffee pieces cannot. The water becomes coloured and flavoured 
        as it runs through the coffee and into a coffee pot.</p>

        <section>
            <h3 id="pressure">Pressure</h3>
            <p>The boiling water is forced through the ground coffee by a machine. This type of coffee 
            is called Espresso and the machine is called an "Espresso machine" or "Coffee system". 
            Espresso machines are often found in cafes and restaurants. Espresso is a very strong 
            coffee that can be used to make other coffee drinks</p>
