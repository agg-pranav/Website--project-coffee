        <p>Before the coffee is made into a drink, it is "ground" in a small grinding machine
        called a "coffee mill". The coffee mill breaks the beans into very small pieces. 
        Coffee is turned into a drink in several different ways. For some ways of making 
        coffee, such as "espresso" it is best to have the coffee ground into fine powder but 
        for other types of coffee-making, such as "filtered coffee", the coffee is in larger 
        pieces to stop it going through the filter. Finely ground coffee makes a stronger taste. </p>

        <p>The whole coffee beans are ground, also known as milling, to facilitate the brewing 
        process. The fineness of the grind strongly affects brewing. Brewing methods that expose 
        coffee grounds to heated water for longer require a coarser grind than faster brewing 
        methods.</p>
