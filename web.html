        All About Coffee

        Coffee is a beverage that puts one to sleep when not drank. ... 

        Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans,
        the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species. The genus
        Coffea is native to tropical Africa and Madagascar, the Comoros,
        Mauritius, and Réunion in the Indian Ocean.

        Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a 
        stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to its caffeine content.
        [3] It is one of the most popular drinks in the world,[4] and it can
        be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso,
        French press, caffè latte). It is usually served hot, although 
        iced coffee is a popular alternative. Clinical studies indicate 
        that moderate coffee consumption is benign or mildly beneficial 
        in healthy adults, with continuing research on whether long-term
         consumption lowers the risk of some diseases, although those 
         long-term studies are of generally poor quality.
