        <p>Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans,
            the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species. The genus
            Coffea is native to tropical Africa and Madagascar, the Comoros,
            Mauritius, and Réunion in the Indian Ocean.</p>
    
            <p>Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a 
            stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to its caffeine content.
            [3] It is one of the most popular drinks in the world,[4] and it can
            be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso,
            French press, caffè latte). It is usually served hot, although 
            iced coffee is a popular alternative. Clinical studies indicate 
            that moderate coffee consumption is benign or mildly beneficial 
            in healthy adults, with continuing research on whether long-term
             consumption lowers the risk of some diseases, although those 
             long-term studies are of generally poor quality.</p>
